OverÂ theÂ last few years IÂ gained aÂ feeling that WordPress requires too much maintenance despite theÂ fact that IÂ haveÂ not beenÂ adding new content toÂ myÂ site. Every few months some plugin broke withÂ aÂ new WordPress version orÂ theÂ site just started toÂ look weird inÂ some browsers orÂ site layout broke onÂ mobile devices etc. AtÂ theÂ end ofÂ 2017 IÂ decided IÂ don't want toÂ waste myÂ time dealing withÂ this kind ofÂ problems anymore andÂ IÂ replaced dynamically generated [WordPress][1] site withÂ static site generated byÂ [Hugo][2].

I'm using Hugo forÂ more than two years now andÂ IÂ am very happy withÂ itÂ mostly because overÂ that period ofÂ time myÂ site required zero maintenance. IÂ remember that content migration took me aÂ little longer than IÂ expected (because IÂ manually reviewed theÂ content ofÂ all myÂ older articles) butÂ IÂ also remember itÂ wasÂ fun. During theÂ migration IÂ created myÂ very own gorgeous theme heavily inspired byÂ theÂ [website withÂ anÂ offensive name][3] which once andÂ forÂ all solved all myÂ previous browser andÂ device compatibility issues.

Things IÂ like most about this change:

- IÂ canÂ use [markdown][4] inÂ myÂ posts
- IÂ maintain theÂ content inÂ [git repository][5]
- MyÂ site isÂ faster andÂ more secure than ever before
- MyÂ site contains zero javascript, zero cookies andÂ zero 3rd party trackers
- MyÂ site isÂ beautiful andÂ "responsive byÂ design"Â ğŸ˜‰
