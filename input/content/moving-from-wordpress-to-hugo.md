Over the last few years I gained a feeling that WordPress requires too much maintenance despite the fact that I have not been adding new content to my site. Every few months some plugin broke with a new WordPress version or the site just started to look weird in some browsers or site layout broke on mobile devices etc. At the end of 2017 I decided I don't want to waste my time dealing with this kind of problems anymore and I replaced dynamically generated [WordPress][1] site with static site generated by [Hugo][2].

I'm using Hugo for more than two years now and I am very happy with it mostly because over that period of time my site required zero maintenance. I remember that content migration took me a little longer than I expected (because I manually reviewed the content of all my older articles) but I also remember it was fun. During the migration I created my very own gorgeous theme heavily inspired by the [website with an offensive name][3] which once and for all solved all my previous browser and device compatibility issues.

Things I like most about this change:

- I can use [markdown][4] in my posts
- I maintain the content in [git repository][5]
- My site is faster and more secure than ever before
- My site contains zero javascript, zero cookies and zero 3rd party trackers
- My site is beautiful and "responsive by design" 😉
