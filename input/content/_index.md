Hello stranger!

My name is Jaroslav and I live in Bratislava, Slovakia. 
I am former system administrator, now full-time software engineer and open source developer enjoying writing software in C and C# languages. 
I am also self-proclaimed PKCS#11 guru and guitar addict.

My professional profile can be viewed on [LinkedIn][1] and most of my open source projects ([Pkcs11Interop][2], [Pkcs11Admin][3], [IPwatchD][4] and others) are hosted on [GitHub][5]. 
I share important information on [Twitter][6] and I like to help other developers on [StackOverflow][7].

From time to time I publish photos on [Instagram][8] and videos on [YouTube][9].

I can be reached via e-mail at [jimrich@jimrich.sk][10] and (hopefully) only I can read information encrypted with my [public GPG key][11].

I occasionally write blog posts. They are available via [RSS feed][12] and also listed here:
