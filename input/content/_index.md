Hello stranger!

My name is Jaroslav and I live in Bratislava, Slovakia. 
I am former system administrator, now full-time software engineer and open source developer enjoying writing software in C and C# languages. 
I am also self-proclaimed PKCS#11 guru and guitar addict.

My professional profile can be viewed on [LinkedIn][1] and most of my open source projects ([Pkcs11Interop][2], [Pkcs11Admin][3], [IPwatchD][4] and others) are hosted on [GitHub][5]. 
I share important information on [Twitter][6] and I like to help other developers on [StackOverflow][7].

I am spending a lot of free time developing and maintaining my open source projects. 
If you like any of them please consider supporting me via [PayPal][8] or [Bitcoin][9]. Any amount is greatly appreciated!

I can be reached via e-mail at [jimrich@jimrich.sk][10] and (hopefully) only I can read information encrypted with my [public GPG key][11].

I occasionally write blog posts. They are available via [RSS feed][12] and also listed here:
