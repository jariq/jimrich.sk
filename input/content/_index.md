Hello stranger!

My name is Jaroslav and I live near Bratislava, the capital and largest city of Slovakia. 
I am former system administrator, now full-time software engineer and open source developer, who enjoys writing software in C and C# languages. 
I am also self-proclaimed PKCS#11 guru and a wannabe rock climber.

My "professional" profile can be viewed on [LinkedIn][1] and most of my open source projects ([Pkcs11Interop][2], [Pkcs11Admin][3], [KUK360][4], [IPwatchD][5] and others) are hosted on [GitHub][6]. 
I share software development related information on [Twitter/X][7] and from time to time I help other developers on [StackOverflow][8].

I publish photos on [Instagram][9] and [Facebook][10], infrequently also videos on [YouTube][11].

I can be reached via e-mail at [jimrich@jimrich.sk][12] and (hopefully) only I can read information encrypted with my [public GPG key][13].

I occasionally write blog posts. They are available via [RSS feed][14] and also listed here:
