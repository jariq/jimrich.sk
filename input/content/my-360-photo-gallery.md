---

My 360° photography journey started in August 2018 just a few days before a trip with my father to Iceland, which I considered to be a once in the lifetime opportunity and so I was looking for a quick and easy way to capture the most of it. 
I somehow came across a YouTube videos showcasing a [Xiaomi Mi Sphere][1] camera and I immediately knew it was the thing I was looking for. 
I bought it and it quickly became one of my favorite photography related tools ever.

360° photos might not be the ones that get most attention and likes (yikes 😬) on social media but for me personally they are definitely the ones that tell the most authentic story of place where they were captured. 
Whenever I go out for a hike or just a short walk I take my 360° camera with me and I take photos of all interesting locations. 
I don't bother with adjusting the camera settings, I just push the button on a selfie stick, camera in AUTO mode beeps and that's it - my memory of the location is captured and recorded on the memory card. 
When I come back home I copy all the photos to my computer, choose the best ones and publish them. 
However getting effectively through a lot of [equirectangular][2] images and selecting the best of them is not an easy thing to do. 
I struggled with this part of the process so hard that I decided to create my own lightweight and fast 360° image viewer. 
I named it [KUK360][3] and I made it available as a closed-source application in [Microsoft Store][4].

Most of the times I publish my 360° photos on [Facebook][5] and [Instagram][6] but neither of these options is ideal. 
Instagram does not support 360° images at all and I have to convert every photo to a rotating video or use an alternative image projection. 
Facebook on the contrary supports 360° images quite well but it makes them hard to reach for unregistered users. 
So in addition to these two places I decided to use open-source viewer called [Pannellum][7] and publish my photos also on my personal website, in this post, which I'll be constantly updating over the time. I hope you'll enjoy them 😉

Please note that photos are published here in their full resolution of 6912*3456 pixels but with JPEG quality reduced to 50% in order to decrease their size and save the bandwidth.
