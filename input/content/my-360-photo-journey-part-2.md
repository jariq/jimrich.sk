Quite a few things happened since my last 360° photography related post.

First of all I open-sourced [KUK360][1]. 
Distribution via Microsoft Store did not meet my expectations. 
I paid 90&nbsp;€ store registration fee and received just 46&nbsp;€ from sales in almost 4 years. 
Money aside, I found Microsoft Store to be very limiting. 
My family and friends could not install the app easily, they needed Microsoft account, promo codes etc. 
Heck, even I did not use the store version myself, I was using local development version instead 🙃. 
I had zero motivation to enhance the app and add new features. 
So after a thorough consideration, I unlisted the app from Microsoft Store and released it as open source on [GitHub][2].
It is completely free now so if you'd like to use it, just run [Next-Next-Finish installer][3] and enjoy 😉

I also started a new hobby - [climbing][4] - and my 360° camera climbs with me (safely stored in a second chalk bag attached to my harness). 
When it comes to 360° photos I still prefer my t/rusty [Xiaomi Mi Sphere][5]. 
Its highly reliable AUTO mode and mechanical shutter button on the selfie stick form an unbeatable combo for extreme conditions. 
I cannot imagine adjusting camera settings or using any other shutter option during my climbs. 
But I bought this camera in July 2018, and now, it is more than five years old. 
It still has original battery installed and I am terrified of the day when it stops working.

So I kind of started to look for a replacement camera and I decided to give [Insta360 X3][6] a try. 
I bought it in January 2023, and after a year of use, I feel qualified to put together a list of its pros and cons:

- **❌ Fragile lenses**  
  Insta360 X3 is advertised as an action cam but it has EXTREMELY fragile lenses. 
  Before I bought it I had seen a lot of people complaining online that they scratched the lenses. 
  At first I though they were not treating the camera properly but then I scratched one lens on my camera too. 
  I was at home, no stress, no harsh conditions, just trying to mount the camera on my helmet. 
  I would never take it to a real rock climbing session after that. 
  It would not survive.
- **❌ Poor photo quality**  
  Insta360 X3 takes 72MP (11968*5984&nbsp;px) photos in normal mode and 18MP (5952*2976&nbsp;px) photos in [HDR][7] mode. 
  The reality however is that those 72MP photos have subjectively lower visual quality than 23MP (6912*3456&nbsp;px) photos taken with Xiaomi Mi Sphere. 
  And HDR photos are almost never sharp enough when taken with the handheld selfie stick (tripod is obviously not an option for me). 
  So I don't use it for photography.
- **❌ Unsuitable shutter options**  
  Insta360 X3 offers a bunch of shutter options. 
  Sadly none of them matches the convenience of a mechanical shutter button integrated in the selfie stick. 
  For example an app on smartphone/smartwatch requires me to use two hands which most of the times is not an option when climbing.
  Voice control requires me to shout _"take photo"_ several times which is not a cool thing to do in echoing places. 
  I tried using button on camera body along with a shutter timer but it requires me to first slide selfie stick down and then get it back up fast. 
  It's not a move you want to do when climbing. 
  I probably could ducktape bluetooth remote to the selfie stick, but I did not even bother as I cannot afford to troubleshoot bluetooth connection issues while climbing.
- **✔️ Great video capabilities**  
  Insta360 X3 is GREAT for video recording. 
  This cam is advertised with "shoot first, frame later" slogan and it's completely true. 
  Captured 360° video can be reframed very easily in the mobile app where video angles can be changed by simply moving the phone in a space around you. 
  That's a KILLER OPTION and it allowed me to me create very unique hiking videos that I published on a social media platforms. 
  For an example take a look at my [winter hike video][8] or [summer hike video][9].
- **✔️ Replaceable batteries**  
  Built-in battery in Xiaomi Mi Sphere dies quickly in freezing temperatures. 
  Insta360 X3 has replaceable battery so I can always keep a spare one in a warmth near my body and replace it when needed. 
  In winter that's an indisputable advantage.
- **✔️ Software updates**  
  Insta360 keeps both mobile and desktop apps constantly updated. 
  That's another indisputable advantage. 
  I prefer iPhone over Android phones for the exact same reason.

To sum it up, I found Insta360 X3 to be a very good tool for 360° videography and a very bad tool for 360° photography. 
And I cannot agree with the statement it is an action cam. It is NOT. Otherwise I wouldn't be still climbing with Xiaomi Mi Sphere 😉

OK, that's enough of ranting for now 🙃. I'll end this post with a few photos taken last year with Xiaomi Mi Sphere on via ferratas (climbing routes that employs steel cables fixed to the rock).
