<div lang="en" class="content">
<p>Over the last few years I gained a feeling that WordPress requires too much maintenance despite the fact that I have not been adding new content to my site. Every few months some plugin broke with a new WordPress version or the site just started to look weird in some browsers or site layout broke on mobile devices etc. At the end of 2017 I decided I don&rsquo;t want to waste my time dealing with this kind of problems anymore and I replaced dynamically generated <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> site with static site generated by <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Hugo for more than two years now and I am very happy with it mostly because over that period of time my site required zero maintenance. I remember that content migration took me a little longer than I expected (because I manually reviewed the content of all my older articles) but I also remember it was fun. During the migration I created my very own gorgeous theme heavily inspired by the <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">website with an offensive name</a> which once and for all solved all my previous browser and device compatibility issues.</p>
<p>Things I like most about this change:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> in my posts</li>
<li>I maintain the content in <a href="https://github.com/jariq/jimrich.sk">git repository</a></li>
<li>My site is faster and more secure than ever before</li>
<li>My site contains zero javascript, zero cookies and zero 3rd party trackers</li>
<li>My site is beautiful and &ldquo;responsive by design&rdquo; ðŸ˜‰</li>
</ul>
