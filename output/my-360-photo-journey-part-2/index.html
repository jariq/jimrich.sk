<p>All parts of the journey:
<a href="/my-360-photo-journey-part-1/">1</a>
2</p>

<p>Quite a few things happened since my last 360° photography related post.</p>

<p>First of all I open-sourced <a href="https://www.kuk360.com/">KUK360</a>.
Distribution via Microsoft Store did not meet my expectations.
I paid 90&nbsp;€ store registration fee and received just 46&nbsp;€ from sales in almost 4 years.
Money aside, I found Microsoft Store to be very limiting.
My family and friends could not install the app easily, they needed Microsoft account, promo codes etc.
Heck, even I did not use the store version myself, I was using local development version instead 🙃.
I had zero motivation to enhance the app and add new features.
So after a thorough consideration, I unlisted the app from Microsoft Store and released it as open source on <a href="https://github.com/jariq/KUK360">GitHub</a>.
It is completely free now so if you&rsquo;d like to use it, just run <a href="https://github.com/jariq/KUK360/releases/latest">Next-Next-Finish installer</a> and enjoy 😉</p>

<p>I also started a new hobby - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/leziem.istim/">climbing</a> - and my 360° camera climbs with me (safely stored in a second chalk bag attached to my harness).
When it comes to 360° photos I still prefer my t/rusty <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220706192732/https://www.mi.com/us/mi-sphere-camera-kit">Xiaomi Mi Sphere</a>.
Its highly reliable AUTO mode and mechanical shutter button on the selfie stick form an unbeatable combo for extreme conditions.
I cannot imagine adjusting camera settings or using any other shutter option during my climbs.
But I bought this camera in July 2018, and now, it is more than five years old.
It still has original battery installed and I am terrified of the day when it stops working.</p>

<p>So I kind of started to look for a replacement camera and I decided to give <a href="https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-x3">Insta360 X3</a> a try.
I bought it in January 2023, and after a year of use, I feel qualified to put together a list of its pros and cons:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>❌ Fragile lenses</strong><br />
Insta360 X3 is advertised as an action cam but it has EXTREMELY fragile lenses.
Before I bought it I had seen a lot of people complaining online that they scratched the lenses.
At first I though they were not treating the camera properly but then I scratched one lens on my camera too.
I was at home, no stress, no harsh conditions, just trying to mount the camera on my helmet.
I would never take it to a real rock climbing session after that.
It would not survive.</li>
<li><strong>❌ Poor photo quality</strong><br />
Insta360 X3 takes 72MP (11968*5984&nbsp;px) photos in normal mode and 18MP (5952*2976&nbsp;px) photos in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range">HDR</a> mode.
The reality however is that those 72MP photos have subjectively lower visual quality than 23MP (6912*3456&nbsp;px) photos taken with Xiaomi Mi Sphere.
And HDR photos are almost never sharp enough when taken with the handheld selfie stick (tripod is obviously not an option for me).
So I don&rsquo;t use it for photography.</li>
<li><strong>❌ Unsuitable shutter options</strong><br />
Insta360 X3 offers a bunch of shutter options.
Sadly none of them matches the convenience of a mechanical shutter button integrated in the selfie stick.
For example an app on smartphone/smartwatch requires me to use two hands which most of the times is not an option when climbing.
Voice control requires me to shout <em>&ldquo;take photo&rdquo;</em> several times which is not a cool thing to do in echoing places.
I tried using button on camera body along with a shutter timer but it requires me to first slide selfie stick down and then get it back up fast.
It&rsquo;s not a move you want to do when climbing.
I probably could ducktape bluetooth remote to the selfie stick, but I did not even bother as I cannot afford to troubleshoot bluetooth connection issues while climbing.</li>
<li><strong>✔️ Great video capabilities</strong><br />
Insta360 X3 is GREAT for video recording.
This cam is advertised with &ldquo;shoot first, frame later&rdquo; slogan and it&rsquo;s completely true.
Captured 360° video can be reframed very easily in the mobile app where video angles can be changed by simply moving the phone in a space around you.
That&rsquo;s a KILLER OPTION and it allowed me to me create very unique hiking videos that I published on a social media platforms.
For an example take a look at my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CroVygGKhxI/">winter hike video</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0H-ir0LIeW/">summer hike video</a>.</li>
<li><strong>✔️ Replaceable batteries</strong><br />
Built-in battery in Xiaomi Mi Sphere dies quickly in freezing temperatures.
Insta360 X3 has replaceable battery so I can always keep a spare one in a warmth near my body and replace it when needed.
In winter that&rsquo;s an indisputable advantage.</li>
<li><strong>✔️ Software updates</strong><br />
Insta360 keeps both mobile and desktop apps constantly updated.
That&rsquo;s another indisputable advantage.
I prefer iPhone over Android phones for the exact same reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>To sum it up, I found Insta360 X3 to be a very good tool for 360° videography and a very bad tool for 360° photography.
And I cannot agree with the statement it is an action cam. It is NOT. Otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t be still climbing with Xiaomi Mi Sphere 😉</p>

<p>OK, that&rsquo;s enough of ranting for now 🙃. I&rsquo;ll end this post with a few photos taken last year with Xiaomi Mi Sphere on via ferratas (climbing routes that employs steel cables fixed to the rock).</p>
