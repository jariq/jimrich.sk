<p>My 360¬∞ photography journey started in August 2018 just a few days before a trip with my father to Iceland, which I considered to be a once in the lifetime opportunity and so I was looking for a quick and easy way to capture the most of it.
I somehow came across a YouTube videos showcasing a <a href="https://www.mi.com/us/mi-sphere-camera-kit">Xiaomi Mi Sphere</a> camera and I immediately knew it was the thing I was looking for.
I bought it and it quickly became one of my favorite photography related tools ever.</p>

<p>360¬∞ photos might not be the ones that get most attention and likes (yikes üò¨) on social media but for me personally they are definitely the ones that tell the most authentic story of place where they were captured.
Whenever I go out for a hike or just a short walk I take my 360¬∞ camera with me and I take photos of all interesting locations.
I don&rsquo;t bother with adjusting the camera settings, I just push the button on a selfie stick, camera in AUTO mode beeps and that&rsquo;s it - my memory of the location is captured and recorded on the memory card.
When I come back home I copy all the photos to my computer, choose the best ones and publish them.
However getting effectively through a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection">equirectangular</a> images and selecting the best of them is not an easy thing to do.
I struggled with this part of the process so hard that I decided to create my own lightweight and fast 360¬∞ image viewer.
I named it <a href="https://jwc.sk/kuk360/">KUK360</a> and I made it available as a closed-source application in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/kuk360/9nl0dh6zp7jv">Microsoft Store</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the times I publish my 360¬∞ photos on <a href="https://facebook.com/kuk360photography">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/kuk360photography">Instagram</a> but neither of these options is ideal.
Instagram does not support 360¬∞ images at all and I have to convert every photo to a rotating video or use an alternative image projection.
Facebook on the contrary supports 360¬∞ images quite well but it makes them hard to reach for unregistered users.
So in addition to these two places I decided to use open-source viewer called <a href="https://pannellum.org/">Pannellum</a> and publish my photos also on my personal website, in this post, which I&rsquo;ll be constantly updating over the time. I hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy them üòâ</p>

<p>Please note that photos are published here in their full resolution of 6912*3456 pixels but with JPEG quality reduced to 50% in order to decrease their size and save the bandwidth.</p>
